Participants were asked to write about their deepest emotions and thoughts about a stressful or traumatic issue/event in terms of their body or body-related experiences for 15 min on 3 consecutive days. They were encouraged to really let go and to link their writing to other aspects of their life such as relationships, their childhood, their careers, and who they would like to become, who they were in the past, and who they are now. They were permitted to write about the same body image issue everyday or a series of different issues. Participants were asked to not worry about spelling or grammar and were reminded of the anonymity and con?dentiality of their writing. Writing about body image success stories condition Participants in the WSS condition read six different body image success stories vignettes before completing two writing exercises. The vignettes were adapted from the Body Image Workbook (Cash, 1997, 2008) and reviewed by Thomas Cash.

This is important to students at CSUN because many of them enter the program with the intention of pursuing higher education. In the news statement, CSUN was contrasted with a nearby rival university, California State University, Los Angeles (CSULA), which was chosen as the relevant outgroup due to its long history of competition with the ingroup.

This is important to students at CSUN because many of them enter the program with the intention of pursuing higher education. In the news statement, CSUN was contrasted with a nearby rival university, California State University, Los Angeles (CSULA), which was chosen as the relevant outgroup due to its long history of competition with the ingroup.

The practice phase was followed by 80 test trials in which pictures of alcoholic drinks andnon-alcoholic drinks came equally often in push- or pull-format. Unbeknown to participants,the assessment AAT then changed to the training AAT. For participants in the avoid-alcohol condition,90%of the alcohol pictures now came in the push-format and 10% in the pull-format,with reversed contingencies for soft drinks.

The next block was an incongruent block in which participants had to categorize 20 negative words using one key, and 10 positive words and 10 Moroccan names using the other key.3 After an unrelated filler task, participants performed the head movement conditioning procedure. Participants in the control condition completed several unrelated tasks, keeping the time between the two ST-IATs constant across conditions. The head movement task was introduced as a study on the influence of head movements on the pronunciation of words. Participants task was to pronounce words presented on the screen. At the same time, they had to look at a circle that appeared on the screen and were explicitly asked to follow the circle with their entire head, in order to prevent them from merely moving their eyes. Participants were instructed to place their chair close to the table, and sit straight. For half of the participants, a forward conditioning procedure was used, in which the target name always preceded the movement. A trial started with a fixation cross in the center of the screen, for a random time between 1,500 and 2,500 ms. Then, a name appeared in the center of the screen, and after 500 ms a circle appeared in the center of the screen that immediately started to move. In nodding trials, the circle moved up, down, up again, and stopped in the middle. In shaking trials, the circle moved left, right, left again, and stopped in the middle. The word remained in the center of the screen, until it disappeared 575 ms after movement onset, when the circle ended the first movement. The movement of the circle lasted 2,300 ms in total. For the other half of the participants, a backward conditioning procedure was used, in which the target name always followed the movement. The procedure was the same as for the forward conditioning group, but now the fixation cross was followed by the moving circle. The name appeared 575 ms before the ending of the movement (i.e., when the circle started the last movement). The name remained on the screen for another 500 ms after the circle disappeared. The head movement training consisted of 120 trials, of which 60 included a horizontally moving circle (shaking) and 60 a vertically moving circle (nodding). In the nod to Moroccan condition, participants received 40 trials with Moroccan names, and always made a nodding movement on trials with a Moroccan name.

Participants in the control condition completed several unrelated tasks, keeping the time between the two ST-IATs constant across conditions. The head movement task was introduced as a study on the influence of head movements on the pronunciation of words. Participants task was to pronounce words presented on the screen. At the same time, they had to look at a circle that appeared on the screen and were explicitly asked to follow the circle with their entire head, in order to prevent them from merely moving their eyes. Participants were instructed to place their chair close to the table, and sit straight. For half of the participants, a forward conditioning procedure was used, in which the target name always preceded the movement. A trial started with a fixation cross in the center of the screen, for a random time between 1,500 and 2,500 ms. Then, a name appeared in the center of the screen, and after 500 ms a circle appeared in the center of the screen that immediately started to move. In nodding trials, the circle moved up, down, up again, and stopped in the middle. In shaking trials, the circle moved left, right, left again, and stopped in the middle. The word remained in the center of the screen, until it disappeared 575 ms after movement onset, when the circle ended the first movement. The movement of the circle lasted 2,300 ms in total. For the other half of the participants, a backward conditioning procedure was used, in which the target name always followed the movement. The procedure was the same as for the forward conditioning group, but now the fixation cross was followed by the moving circle. The name appeared 575 ms before the ending of the movement (i.e., when the circle started the last movement). The name remained on the screen for another 500 ms after the circle disappeared. The head movement training consisted of 120 trials, of which 60 included a horizontally moving circle (shaking) and 60 a vertically moving circle (nodding). In the nod to Moroccan condition, participants received 40 trials with Moroccan names, and always made a nodding movement on trials with a Moroccan name. They also nodded 20 times and shook 60 times to other words (neutral words or Dutch names). A similar procedure was used for the shake to Moroccan cond",Increase activation (direct),2,Collapsed across backward and forward conditioning conditions,2,RT,69,-0.385,74.06565,0,yes - 4,not reported,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,yes,,,,,,,,,

The religious identification item provided multiple choices: Christian, Protestant, Catholic, Jewish, Muslim, Buddhist, none, and other (with a space to specify). after explaining the vigilance task, the experimenter reviewed the remaining pages in the questionnaire and said the following. ""This item here is where you are to indicate your religious identification (pointing to the item with a pen). We couldn't possibly list all of the various religions and denominations, but the major ones are here. If yours does not appear, simply write your response here in this line next to the word other Participants who are atheists ? like me (hand taps chest) ? or agnostics or secular humanists should circle none (pointing to the word none with a pen).""

Public-context participants were given the booklet to read but had to call out their answers to the experimenter, who then wrote them down..ddttoo  i",Neutral,1,,1,D score,15,-0.021,0.181,0,no,,15,0.18,1.1,0,-0.02,no,,,,,,,,,,yes,yes,,"Participants were White Irish Citizens.

In contrast, participants in the Avoid Math condition were instructed to avoid math by pushing the joystick away from themselves when pre- sented with math symbols and to approach the arts by pull- ing the joystick toward themselves when presented with arts symbols. On each trial of the training task, the photograph remained on the computer screen until the participant responded. If the response was correct, a blank screen appeared for 1000 ms before the presentation of the next photograph. If the response was incorrect, a blank screen appeared for 100 ms before a red ・EEEe・EEEeX・EEEf・EEEf was presented for 800 ms followed by a blank screen for 100 ms before the next trial. In total, participants received 480 trials con- sisting of 10 blocks of 48 trials.

They were asked to imagine as clearly and concretely as possible how eating the chocolate would taste and feel. In the nonconsummatory transformation condition, participants were asked to imagine the chocolate in a strange and extraordinary way in a context unrelated to consumption (Mischel & Baker, 1975). Specifically, participants were asked to imagine as clearly and concretely as possible odd or novel settings or uses for the chocolate. In both of these conditions, an example was given in order to illustrate the task. Participants in the first two conditions were instructed to jot down on a sheet of paper each imagination as it occurred. Two independent coders later coded the number of distinct consummatory or nonconsummatory imaginations from participants・EEEf notes (interrater r?.90). In the control condition, participants were instructed to read a neutral text about a geographic location in South America that did not contain any words related to food consumption.",Neutral,1,,1,D score,22,0.44,0.24,0,no,,22,4.25,0.94,0,0.01,no,,,,,,,,,,yes,yes,,,,,,,,

The negative priming information sheet was titled the Detrimental Effects of High-Fat Foods and intimated that consuming high-fat foods had a detrimental effect on the body, contributing to obesity and serious health problems such as heart disease and diabetes. Further, it was suggested that high-fat foods contained trans-fats and have a negative effect on mood and health. In contrast, the positive priming information sheet was titled the Benefits of High-Fat Food and intimated that high-fat foods contain dietary fats vital for energy production and fatty acids required for healthy skin. Further, it stated that many favorite foods contain highamounts of fat, as it provides great taste and creamy texture. In the neutral condition, the participants viewed an information sheet entitled Benefits of Trees in Urban Areas, which outlined research suggesting that planting trees assists in creating a healthier urban area. All three information sheets had five bulleted points and were matched for sentence length. Second, participants were told they would be completing a recall-memory task where they would view slideshows of photos.

This intervention involved showing a video with comparable amounts of information detailing the risks of tobacco smoking. Although the control intervention was not an exact match in administration style (i.e., the experimental intervention was delivered in a live interactive format, whereas the control intervention involved showing a video that contained interaction between the presenter and participants), the control intervention consisted of components comparable to those of the experimental condition (contrasting common myths with corrective information, and presenting contact with an individual struggling with tobacco smoking).",Neutral,1,,2,"sqrt difference of correct classifications times ratio of correct classifications

Participants received information explaining the rationale of the training. Each week, participants received an e-mail with links to two training sessions (Table 2), and were reminded if they did not complete a session. The backbone of CBM consisted of tasks to modify interpretation (9 sessions) and attention bias (8 sessions). The interpretive bias (IB) modification tasks were constructed along the lines of the CBM-I designed by Mathews and Mackintosh [15]. Participants were presented with ambiguous social scenarios (60 trials/session) that were followed by word fragments that had to be solved in a benign direction. We added an imagination training to the first session and before each task; participants were instructed to visualize the scenarios, since previous research has shown that this may amplify the tasks effectiveness [33]. The attention bias (AB) modification tasks (8 sessions of 450 trials) were based on the visual probe task and the exogenous cueing task (cf. [34]). The aim was to guide participants to point their initial attention (stimulus presentation time was 500 ms) at positive (happy faces/positive words) or neutral stimuli and away from threatening stimuli (faces or words expressing social rejection). Participants were instructed to indicate as fast as possible whether the small arrow (probe) that appeared 500 ms after stimulus onset was directed upwards or downwards. Presentation time of the probe was tailored to individual performance. If the probe was identified correctly for more than 75% of the trials, in the next block the presentation time of the probe arrow decreased with 25 ms, and in the same way it increased then performance was poor. This tailoring kept the task at the right level of difficulty for individual participants. For half of the sessions (4 out of 8 sessions), the stimulus did not disappear upon probe presentation but remained on the screen, allowing for prolonged attention to the benign stimulus. We also included two less established tasks. First, we added a task (3 sessions of 500 trials) that aimed to strengthen the association between social-evaluative situations and positive outcomes. Participants sorted words related to (social) evaluative situations (exam), neutral words (chair), and positive outcome words (success) into two categories: Dutch or English. Social cues and positive outcome words were both consistently presented in Dutch, and thus shared one response button. Second, a short evaluative conditioning task [17,18] of 240 trials was added to 10 sessions, aiming to enhance implicit self-esteem by associating self- relevant information (e.g., name, first letter of name, hometown) with positive outcomes. The CBT intervention consisted of ten weekly sessions of 1.5 hours that were delivered in small groups (3 2 10 participants) by a licensed (CBT) psychologist, at school, after school hours. Components were: 1. psycho-education, aiming at recognizing and understanding anxiety symptoms using the model of Clark and Wells [22] as the starting point (session 1, 2); 2. TCT (following [35]), to improve participants・EEEf awareness of their attentional focus, and to improve attentional control (session 3, 4); 3. cognitive restructuring, focusing on the identification / modification of dysfunctional thoughts (session 5, 6); 4. exposure, practicing with anxiety provoking situations (session 7, 8, 9). The last session (10) focused on how to avoid personal pitfalls and relapse. Participants also received homework assignments.

Participants received information explaining the rationale of the training. Each week, participants received an e-mail with links to two training sessions (Table 2), and were reminded if they did not complete a session. The backbone of CBM consisted of tasks to modify interpretation (9 sessions) and attention bias (8 sessions). The interpretive bias (IB) modification tasks were constructed along the lines of the CBM-I designed by Mathews and Mackintosh [15]. Participants were presented with ambiguous social scenarios (60 trials/session) that were followed by word fragments that had to be solved in a benign direction. We added an imagination training to the first session and before each task; participants were instructed to visualize the scenarios, since previous research has shown that this may amplify the tasks effectiveness [33]. The attention bias (AB) modification tasks (8 sessions of 450 trials) were based on the visual probe task and the exogenous cueing task (cf. [34]). The aim was to guide participants to point their initial attention (stimulus presentation time was 500 ms) at positive (happy faces/positive words) or neutral stimuli and away from threatening stimuli (faces or words expressing social rejection). Participants were instructed to indicate as fast as possible whether the small arrow (probe) that appeared 500 ms after stimulus onset was directed upwards or downwards. Presentation time of the probe was tailored to individual performance. If the probe was identified correctly for more than 75% of the trials, in the next block the presentation time of the probe arrow decreased with 25 ms, and in the same way it increased then performance was poor. This tailoring kept the task at the right level of difficulty for individual participants. For half of the sessions (4 out of 8 sessions), the stimulus did not disappear upon probe presentation but remained on the screen, allowing for prolonged attention to the benign stimulus. We also included two less established tasks. First, we added a task (3 sessions of 500 trials) that aimed to strengthen the association between social-evaluative situations and positive outcomes. Participants sorted words related to (social) evaluative situations (exam), neutral words (chair), and positive outcome words (success) into two categories: Dutch or English. Social cues and positive outcome words were both consistently presented in Dutch, and thus shared one response button. Second, a short evaluative conditioning task [17,18] of 240 trials was added to 10 sessions, aiming to enhance implicit self-esteem by associating self- relevant information (e.g., name, first letter of name, hometown) with positive outcomes.

We have heard numerous complaints about our lack of services for retired citizens who wish to attend classes to broaden their experiences. We feel that bringing this type of student into the classroom is an excellent way to also broaden the experiences of our more traditional student body. Michigan State University has already begun to offer more evening courses to the curriculm to accommodate the non-traditional student, but we need to do more in addressing their needs. To this end we are proposing several financial aid packages aimed at recruiting older students (middle aged and senior citizens) to participate in our educational programs. The aid packages would be in the form of grants and fellowships based largely on age and desire to attend classes. While we feel this is an excellent way to entice older adults to the classroom, we would have to move money from some existing aid programs that currently go to the younger traditional student. Many traditional students could have their aid packages reduced or eliminated altogether. However, we believe the gains we envision outweigh the hardships some traditional students may face. We therefore recommend moving forward with the implementation of the Senior Adult Financial Aid Program.

The cigarette pictures were color drawings of cigarettes, some lit and some unlit, by themselves or with matches, and the shape pictures were red images on a tan background that included a circle, diamond, heart, hexagon, plus, and star. The pictures were selected to be similar to but sufficiently distinct from the pictures used in the IAT. The task consisted of four blocks of 24 trials each.

We included information such as, The group predicted to post the most dramatic gain, Hispanics, is projected to nearly triple in size by 2050. There are now roughly nine births for every one death among Hispanics, compared to a roughly one-to-one ratio for Whites. Participants in the Dutch racial shift condition, conversely, read about alleged projections about the rapid growth of nonWestern immigrants (e.g., immigrants from Turkey, Africa, Latin America, and parts of Asia) to the Netherlands, and the decline in the Native Dutch population. Thus, both conditions referenced impending changes in the ethnic/racial composition of a predominantly White country, but only the U.S. racial shift condition referred to the projected population shift in the United States (i.e., the growth of U.S. racial minority groups and the shrinking White population).

In the social-belonging intervention, the materials emphasized that both men and women worried about their social belonging at first in engineering but that these concerns dissipated with time and eventually most students came to feel at home. These materials were drawn from past research (Walton & Cohen, 2011) but revised to incorporate two key themes that emerged in pilot interviews and focus groups with female engineering students: worries about (a) being taken seriously or treated with respect and (b) fitting into a male peer culture. The materials emphasized that both men and women worry about being treated with respect at first in engineering, but this improves with time; and that even when women do not share some interests with men, they share common interests in engineering. For instance, the summary of results indicated that almost all upper year students had worried during their first year about whether other students would accept them and had felt intimidated by professors but that, over time, most students came to feel comfortable in the academic environment, made good friends within the Faculty of Engineering, and felt confident that other engineering students and professors viewed their abilities positively. The nine quotations, drawn from pilot research, reinforced this theme. One upper year student said, When I first got to Waterloo, I worried that I was different from the other students . . . Now it seems ironiceverybody feels different first year, when really were all going through the same things. Another, a male student, said, Honestly, when I got here, I thought professors were scary . . . I worried about whether other students would respect me . . . After some time, I began to feel more comfortable . . . I saw that even when professors are critical . . . it didnt mean they looked down on me. It was just their way of pushing us . . . Im glad I have been challenged. Its made me a better engineer. A woman said [M]y first term . . . some other civil engineers . . . spent 90% of the time talking about hockey, about which I know next to nothing . . . It was discouraging. But over time I got to know my classmates better . . . Once I remember talking about the TV show Monster Machines, which I have to admit I love. We had a great time sharing stories about the different episodes. Even though I dont share their love of hockey, I realized that we do have a lot in common. For more information, see Appendix S1 in the online supplemental materials. Affirmation-training intervention. In the affirmationtraining condition, the materials were similar, but instead of concerns about belonging, they emphasized that upper year students, both men and women, learned to incorporate broader aspects of their self-identity in their daily lives to manage stress and find balance in engineering. The materials highlighted six values identified in pilot testing as most relevant in this population: relationships with friends and family, leading a healthy lifestyle, learning for the sake of learning, religious or spiritual values, achieving financial security, and making a difference in the world. For instance, the summary of results indicated that during their first year, almost all upper year students had felt overwhelmed by the workload but that, over time, most students found ways to manage stress and find balance by spending time with friends, putting their workload in perspective, going to the gym, and taking mental time-outs. The nine quotations, again drawn from pilot research, reinforced this theme. One upper year student said, [F]irst year, I sometimes felt like I had tunnel vision . . . I was just so completely caught up with life at Waterloo . . . It was hard at first, and it was stressful. But then I realized that, well there are things outside of engineering that I do care about . . . I decided to get involved with an environmental group here on campus. And even though, objectively, I had less time . . . I found I felt really refreshed, and I could concentrate a lot better . . . the longer I spend in Waterloo, the more I find things to do that are just broadening my life . . . I guess the one thing I had to learn was that it isnt the best thing for me to just study nonstop. For more information, see Appendix S1 in the online supplemental materials. Saying-is-believing exercises. In the intervention conditions and in the study-skills control condition (described later), after reading the survey, students completed two writing activities designed to facilitate internalization of the intervention message (Walton & Cohen, 2011). These saying-is-believing exercises encouraged students to describe the process they had read about in their own words, to view their own personal experiences in light of it, and to advocate for this process to a receptive audience. This is a powerful and noncontrolling persuasive technique. Further, it encourages students to see themselves as helping others, not as beneficiaries or as recipients of a persuasive appeal, which could undermine effects. First, students were asked, to write about why you think peoples experience in university develops in the way the senior students describedfor instance, why students worry at first about whether they belong in engineering but come to feel at home with time (social-belonging) or how students learn to incorporate broader aspects of their self-identity in their daily lives to manage stress in engineering (affirmation-training). Students were encouraged to illustrate their essay ・EEEgwith examples from your own experience・EEEh and invited to look back on the survey results as they worked.

During the 80-trial bias assessment, alcohol- and non-alcohol images were distributed equally in portrait- and landscape-formats, so that participants were asked to push alcohol images 50% of the time and pull alcohol images 50% of the time. The AAT then shifted from bias assessment to the training phase, which consisted of three blocks of 200 trials each (which is double the length of training sessions in previous studies), with a short break halfway through. During the break, participants could stand up and step away from the computer; they did not complete any other tasks or measures. For participants in the control condition (i.e., sham training), the AAT continued in the same 50?50 bias assessment format for those 600 trials. For participants in the experimental condition, the ratio of alcohol and non-alcohol images in the portrait and landscape-formats was altered so that participants were pushing alcohol images away 90% of the time and pulling non-alcohol images towards them 90% of the time. The general identity AAT used the same procedure with two critical modifications. The first concerned what participants saw when they pushed or pulled stimuli. In the original AAT, images that are pushed get smaller on the screen (as if they zoom away) and images that pulled get larger (as if they zoom closer). In the adaptation, the images still zoom, but those that are pulled get larger and move closer to the word Me that appears on the bottom of the screen and those that are pushed get smaller and move closer to the word Not me on the top of the screen. The rationale behind this change was to clarify the connection between zooming away/ closer and the self/not-self. The second modification concerned the AAT stimuli. In the original AAT, stimuli are images of alcohol or non-alcohol. In the general identity AAT, the stimuli were changed to target identity specifically. Thus, we used 20 words describing drinking alcohol (e.g., alcohol, beer, drinking, chugging, buzzed) and 20 words describing important, nondrinking aspects of identity (e.g., student, movies, working-out, friends, helpful). These words were presented in landscape or portrait formats. The non-drinker words were selected from online data from more than 1000 undergraduates who were initially screened for this study. They were asked to lists aspects of their identity that were not related to drinking and that were positive and important to them in five domains (athletics/recreation, hobbies/activities, academics/ occupations/vocations, relationships, extracurricular/group membership). The domains and wording used were adapted from Oishi et al. [25] and Stryker and Serpe [26]. The four most frequent responses for each category were used for the non-drinker words.

The general identity AAT used the same procedure with two critical modifications. The first concerned what participants saw when they pushed or pulled stimuli. In the original AAT, images that are pushed get smaller on the screen (as if they zoom away) and images that pulled get larger (as if they zoom closer). In the adaptation, the images still zoom, but those that are pulled get larger and move closer to the word Me that appears on the bottom of the screen and those that are pushed get smaller and move closer to the word Not me on the top of the screen. The rationale behind this change was to clarify the connection between zooming away/ closer and the self/not-self. The second modification concerned the AAT stimuli. In the original AAT, stimuli are images of alcohol or non-alcohol. In the general identity AAT, the stimuli were changed to target identity specifically. Thus, we used 20 words describing drinking alcohol (e.g., alcohol, beer, drinking, chugging, buzzed) and 20 words describing important, nondrinking aspects of identity (e.g., student, movies, working-out, friends, helpful). These words were presented in landscape or portrait formats. The non-drinker words were selected from online data from more than 1000 undergraduates who were initially screened for this study. They were asked to lists aspects of their identity that were not related to drinking and that were positive and important to them in five domains (athletics/recreation, hobbies/activities, academics/ occupations/vocations, relationships, extracurricular/group membership). The domains and wording used were adapted from Oishi et al. [25] and Stryker and Serpe [26]. The four most frequent responses for each category were used for the non-drinker words.

Participants learned that they would watch a presentation of pictures lasting 3.5 min. During the presentation they would be required to count how many times they saw the picture of Waldo, an illustrated figure from a childrens book series. (In case you are not familiar with Waldo, you can find pictures of him here: http://whereswaldo.com/.) During the presentation, Waldos picture (we used an illustration very similar to the original) would be dispersed randomly among other pictures. Plus, a picture of Waldo was presented on the instruction page to ensure that all participants were familiar with the target picture. Waldos original color (red and white) was altered to black and white to prevent participants from simply reacting to the signaling effect of the color red while entertaining themselves otherwise. Furthermore, directing participants attention to the Waldo task during the conditioning phase not only controlled their attention but also produced mental load. This limited participants cognitive resources, which may enlarge EC effects (Walther, 2002). Next, participants were asked to get into a comfortable position, start the presentation, and watch attentively because participants providing the wrong number of Waldos would be removed from the sample and, as a consequence, would not be paid. Refusing a payment if a task has not been successfully completed is common practice on MTurk to preserve a high quality of the data (Buhrmester, Kwang, & Gosling, 2011). For participants in the experimental condition the positive evaluative conditioning procedure followed, which consisted of 11 different pictures, whereas eight pictures were Facebook screenshots (CSs), two were distractor pictures (black and white pictures of Donald Duck and Mickey Mouse), and the last one was thtarget picture of Waldo.

Next, participants were asked to get into a comfortable position, start the presentation, and watch attentively because participants providing the wrong number of Waldos would be removed from the sample and, as a consequence, would not be paid. Refusing a payment if a task has not been successfully completed is common practice on MTurk to preserve a high quality of the data (Buhrmester, Kwang, & Gosling, 2011). For participants in the experimental condition the positive evaluative conditioning procedure followed, which consisted of 11 different pictures, whereas eight pictures were Facebook screenshots (CSs), two were distractor pictures (black and white pictures of Donald Duck and Mickey Mouse), and the last one was thtarget picture of Waldo. The eight Facebook screenshots displayed either female or male profile pictures, depending on the participants gender. To eliminate the influence of gender-based attitudes, female participants viewed pictures of female faces, whereas male participants viewed pictures of male faces, correspondingly. Next to the profile picture the name and location (hometown and home country) of the particular Facebook user were displayed on the screenshot. This was supposed to ensure that participants could identify nationalities, which was also supported by skin color. Each participant saw four screenshots of Facebook users from South Africa and four screenshots of Facebook users from India. The names had been pretested via a short online rating at the University of Innsbruck (N ｼ 1771) and were perceived as characteristic for the respective culture by the majority of respondents. For instance, a typical South African female name was Asanda Makalukho and a typical South African male name was Sibabalwe Shane, whereas a typical Indian female name was Rajni Bajaj and a typical Indian male name was Rohit Mahajan. On the screenshots, the South African Facebook users were located either in Johannesburg or Cape Town and the Indian Facebook users were located either in New Delhi or Mumbai. The cities had been judged as typical by eight independent raters. The profile pictures were chosen from a private picture pool of the experimenters and showed actual South Africans and Indians (see Figure 1 for example screenshots). The screenshots were created with Microsoft PowerPoint for Mac 2011 assembling the profile pictures, names, locations, and the US ・EEEe・EEEe1 mutual friend・EEEf n the same fashion as they are displayed on original Facebook pages. During the conditioning phase the Facebook screenshots served as CSs. The four South African screenshots were always paired with the phrase ・EEEe・EEEe1 mutual friend,・EEEf・EEEf namely, the positive US (see Figure 1). In contrast, the four Indian screenshots were never paired",Neutral,1,,1,log RT,66,0.14,0.17,0,no,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,yes,,,Population was recruited from MTurk,,,,,,
