Slide 1: Effect sizes from psychology, 

* Explain what an effect size is; (lower left-hand side, use N(theta, 1)
* Mention "small study effect".

Slide 2: What causes this?
Selective outcome reporting  (publication bias) [find example]
Selective analysis reporting (p-hacking)        [find example]
(Maybe: Researchers adjusting for sample size for underlying power.)

Slide 4:




Let's take Borel([0, 2\pi]^2) as the sigma-algebra.


Sounds about right, but I think you should say that the model A is N(12, 1) and model B is N(13, 1), not that they predict N(12, 1) or N(13, 1). In addition, if you allow non-trivial priors over the parameters for either model, that scenario would probably never happen.  

If the Bayes factor is somewhat reasonable, I suppose a factor of 1 with N = 10^8 would give you some information, most likely one of 1.) your likelihood(s) are wrong, or 2.) your priors are bad.
